            <p>
                Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold": <br><br>

                <li>
                    If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn
                    continues.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next
                    player's turn.
                </li>
                The first player to score <b>100</b> or more points wins. <br><br>

                For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn and rolls a 5. Donald could hold and score 5
                points, but chooses to
                roll again. Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again.
                Donald rolls a 1,
                and must end his turn without scoring.<br> The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4, 5, 3, 5, 6,
                after
                which she
                chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 23 points to her score.
